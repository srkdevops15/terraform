In Terraform, a data block is used to define and retrieve data from existing resources in your infrastructure. This is particularly useful when you want to reference resources that are not managed by your Terraform configuration but are still relevant for the resources you want to create or modify.

# Specify the AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Change this to your desired region
}

# Data source to find the latest Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI
data "aws_ami" "latest_ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  owners = ["099720109477"]  # Canonical's account ID for Ubuntu

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]  # Pattern for Ubuntu 20.04
  }
}

# Resource to create an EC2 instance using the retrieved AMI
resource "aws_instance" "ubuntu_instance" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest_ubuntu.id  # Use the latest Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"                       # Instance type

  tags = {
    Name = "MyUbuntuInstance"                       # Tag for the instance
  }
}
