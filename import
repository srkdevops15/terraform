The terraform import command is used to bring existing infrastructure into Terraform's management. 
It allows you to manage resources that were created outside of Terraform, such as resources created manually through the AWS Management Console or by another tool. 
Importing resources enables you to manage them with Terraform by creating a configuration that matches the existing infrastructure.

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Make sure to specify the correct region
}


resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # No arguments are needed here for import
}

terraform init
terraform import aws_instance.example i-081c67223a4634792
