Create an EC2 Instance on AWS using Terraform
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform. Follow the sections below to set up your EC2 instance effortlessly.

Steps :
1. Create ec2_instance.tf File
Create a file named ec2_instance.tf in your project directory and add the following content:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.10.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = "<access-key>"
  secret_key = "<secret-key>"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0f34c5ae932e6f0e4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform_ec2"
  }
}
Replace and with your AWS access and secret keys.

2. Initialize Terraform
Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing ec2_instance.tf, and run the following command:

terraform init
This command initializes Terraform, downloads the necessary provider plugins, and prepares the working directory for configuration.

3. Generate Terraform Plan
To see what changes Terraform will apply, run the following command:

terraform plan
Terraform will analyze your configuration and display a preview of the resources that will be created or modified.

4. Apply Terraform Configuration
To create the EC2 instance, execute the following command:

terraform apply
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type yes and press Enter. It will then provision the EC2 instance based on your configuration.
