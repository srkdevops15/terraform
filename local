Locals are a feature in Terraform that allow you to define named values that can be reused throughout your configuration. 
They help in maintaining cleaner and more manageable code by reducing redundancy and improving readability.

# locals.tf
locals {
  region         = "us-east-1"        # AWS region
  instance_type  = "t2.micro"          # EC2 instance type
  ami_id         = "ami-12345678"      # Example AMI ID
  environment     = "production"        # Environment tag
}
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = local.region  # Use the local value for the region
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = local.ami_id          # Reference the local AMI ID
  instance_type = local.instance_type   # Reference the local instance type

  tags = {
    Name        = "ExampleInstance"     # Tag for the instance
    Environment = local.environment      # Reference the local environment
  }
}
